This is a continuation of the original [littlebitstudios/SteamElevator](https://github.com/littlebitstudios/SteamElevator) project. The original project was a WinForms application that allows you to easily quit and restart Steam with administrator privileges. This project does the same thing, but as a console app that simply switches between the two states (admin or not admin) when the app is run.

This app cannot be used from within Steam. I recommend adding a shortcut to your desktop.
# Installation
Find the latest version in the releases. Download the zip file and extract it to a location of your choice (I use %USERPROFILE%\userapps). The actions of running the file are different depending on the current state of the Steam client.
# Function
The flow of the program is as follows:
- Steam running as non-admin
  - Steam will close and restart as admin
- Steam running as admin
  - Steam will close and restart as non-admin
- Steam not running
  - Steam will start as admin
  
In the cases where Steam is to start as an admin, you will see a UAC prompt appear (sometimes labeled as "Windows Security"). This is normal and is required for Steam to run as an administrator.

# Purpose
Some games (notably games from HoYoverse or Kuro Games) require administrator privileges to run. Steam can still launch these games in its non-admin state (a UAC prompt appears), but the Steam overlay will not function which prevents some games such as Genshin Impact or Honkai Star Rail from being closed using a controller. This program allows you to easily switch between the two states without having to manually close Steam and start it with the "Run as administrator" option.
