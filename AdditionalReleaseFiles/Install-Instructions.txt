This software's installer is a PowerShell script.
By default, Windows does not allow running PowerShell scripts for security reasons.
To run the installer, you need to allow PowerShell scripts on your system.

Instructions for Allowing PowerShell Scripts

1. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges:
    - Press `Win + X` or right click the Start Menu and select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.
    - On Windows 11, you may have to click "Terminal (Admin)" instead.

2. Check the current execution policy:
    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

3. If the execution policy is set to `Restricted`, change it to `RemoteSigned` or `Unrestricted`:
    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

4. Confirm the change by typing `Y` and pressing `Enter`.

5. Verify the new execution policy:
    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

6. You can now run PowerShell scripts on your system.

Note: Be cautious when setting the execution policy to `Unrestricted` as it allows running all scripts without any restrictions.

Alternate Method (Windows 11 Only)
1. Type "setting:developer" in the Windows search bar and select "Use developer features".
2. Select "PowerShell", and enable the toggle switch for "Change execution policy to allow local PowerShell scripts to run without signing".
